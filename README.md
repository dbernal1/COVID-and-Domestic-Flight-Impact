## Impact of COVID-19 on Domestic Air Transportation

### Welcome!
This analysis focuses on the impact that COVID-19 has had on air transportation in the USA. The idea of working with COVID data surged from a previous professional experience where I had the chance to create and enhance a dataset to track the impact on suppliers across the world. Despite the type of information by industry differs, I wanted to take the opportunity to analyze air transportation data to identify any trends/changes that this industry has suffered during 2020. 

### Dataset
The dataset that I selected is available in [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/akulbahl/covid19-airline-flight-delays-and-cancellations/tasks) and contains domestic flight data from January to February.

### Analysis
For the analysis I used Python pandas and several graphing libraries. The visualization tools included line plots, bar plots, choropleths, and scattergeo plots. With them, I was able to identify the preferred destinations, frequency of travel, cancelled flights over months, etc.

### Visualization

### Findings
We find that Texas, California, and Florida are the states that scheduled the most flights during this time where we identify American Airlines as the carrier with the highest volume. Starting from March, all cancellations started going up where we see Chicago as the most cancelled destination nationwide. Furthermore, in terms of miles uncovered, Southwest and American Airlines are the companies with the highest numbers. Lastly, as this is an ongoing topic, the data availability and reliability becomes a major constraint. Looking forward, it would be usefulful to collect similar data to analyze it and identify new trends.
