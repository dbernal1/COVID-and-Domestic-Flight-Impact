## Impact of COVID-19 on Domestic Air Transportation

### Welcome!
This analysis focuses on the impact that COVID-19 has had on air transportation in the USA. The idea of working with COVID data surged from a previous professional experience where I had the chance to create and enhance a dataset to track the impact on suppliers accross the world. Despite the type information by industry differs, I wanted to take the opportunity to analyze air transportation data to identify any trends/changes that this industry has sufferred during 2020. 

### Dataset
The dataset that I selected is available in [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/akulbahl/covid19-airline-flight-delays-and-cancellations/tasks) and contains domestic flight data from January to February.
